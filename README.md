# Digital Store
The digital store project where I have been developed using Core Java, a software
application designed to simulate the functionalities of an online store. It provides a user-
friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase products conveniently, in this
project I have implemented various features such as user registration and login,
product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, and payment processing
and Registered user details will be stored in files.
